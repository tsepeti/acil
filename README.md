# Why `acil` ?

When we get **errors** for some of our applications, we have to `look`. But if you use **acil**, your mistakes will come to your **e-mail** address.

## How to run

    yarn add acil
    
Open `package.json` and add the following scripts:

```JS
"scripts": {
  "start": "acil server.js" // <-- your server application file
}
```
